## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

This project was very fun to build. Quiet easy, but I love the usage of colors and this yellow is just stunning. I already knew `clamp()` function but working on this project showed me different usage of it `clamp(1.4rem, 1.2rem + 0.5vw, 1.6rem)` which helps to change font size based on window width.

### Continued development

In the future I definitely want to more simple projects because they help me organize my knowledge and I find a new things everytime I move back to basics. Never ending journey, but that what is fun in being a developer.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This function helped me with changing font size without using media queries.
- [Dynamic viewport height](https://dev.to/frehner/css-vh-dvh-lvh-svh-and-vw-units-27k4) - Great article about dynamic viewport height for removing scroll on mobile device.
